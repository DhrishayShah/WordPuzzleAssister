# WordPuzzleAssister

I implemented algorithms using Java to assist a user with solving word puzzles(e.g crossword puzzles). If a user knows the length of the word and some letters my method returns a list of the matching words in a dictionary.

I used test cases to ensure the algorithms I wrote where correct.
